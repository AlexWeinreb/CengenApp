This is a light version that loads a smaller dataset.

Functionalities unavailable:
* Enriched Genes by cell type
* Find Differential Expression between Cell Types
* Single cell plot

Unaffected:
* Gene expression by cell type
* Find markers based on percentage of expression
* Heatmaps of gene expression

It requires about 300 MB of RAM to run.

On Windows, you can use "run.bat" to launch it without opening R yourself.
